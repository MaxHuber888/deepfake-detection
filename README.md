# Comparative Analysis of Deepfake Detection Models

In this project we aim to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of deepfake video detection models, leveraging the open-source Deepstar toolkit. This toolkit provides training data and two example neural networks for deepfake detection. Our goal is to train the two networks and compare their effectiveness, and then use our insights to design our own model and compare it to the original two. We will speculate about the impact a given model’s structure has on the given model’s performance. Our aim is to improve our model to be as accurate as possible, and ideally at least as accurate as the two examples.
